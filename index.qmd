# Welcome to my blog

I'm Michael. I recently graduated with a Masters of Science in Civic Analytics from UIC. I am passionate about civic technology projects and urbanism. I live in Avondale with my wife Becky and cat Malbec.

During my masters program, we often produced data projects using RMarkdown or Quarto. With my newly attained free time, I hope to continue developing my data analysis skills in this blog format.
